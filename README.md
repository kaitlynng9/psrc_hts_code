Data is from PSRC 2017-2019-2021 survey wave: https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program
- Download the Household_Travel_Survey_Trips and Household_Travel_Survey_Households files for data analysis. These contain information on each trip and each household, respectively.
- The codebook in this repo has information on what variables are present in the household travel survey and how to interpret them. The codebook doesn't match up perfectly but is pretty close.

The Jupyter notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on the household travel survey, looking at trip characteristics and sociodemographic characteristics of individuals making the trips.
